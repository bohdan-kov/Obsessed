# Analytics Section - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Executive Summary

The Analytics page will provide gym enthusiasts with **deep, actionable insights** beyond the high-level Dashboard overview. While the Dashboard shows "what happened" (volume, frequency, muscle distribution), Analytics answers **strategic questions**:
- "Am I getting stronger?"
- "Which exercises drive my progress?"
- "Am I balancing my training?"
- "How efficient are my workouts?"

**Core Philosophy**: Every chart must help the user make a training decision. No vanity metrics.

---

## 1. Background Analysis

### 1.1 What Dashboard Already Provides

To avoid redundancy, we must understand what already exists:

| Dashboard Feature | Data Shown | Time Period | User Value |
|-------------------|------------|-------------|------------|
| **Training Volume Chart** | Volume (kg) and exercise count over time | Last 30 days | Shows workout intensity trends |
| **Muscle Distribution** | Sets by muscle group (donut chart) | Current period snapshot | Shows current training balance |
| **Training Frequency** | GitHub-style heatmap | Last 12 months | Shows workout consistency |
| **Period Comparison** | Volume, workouts, avg volume comparison | Current vs previous period | Shows progress direction |
| **Quick Stats** | Total workouts, volume load, rest days, current streak | Last 30 days | At-a-glance performance |

### 1.2 Available Data (from analyticsStore + workoutStore)

**Currently Computed** (can be reused/extended):
- `totalWorkouts`
- `totalVolume`
- `totalExercises`
- `restDays`
- `currentStreak`
- `bestStreak`
- `avgWorkoutDuration`
- `avgWeightPerWorkout`
- `muscleGroupDistribution` (sets by muscle)
- `exerciseHistory` (recent exercises with sets/reps/weight)
- `volumeOverTime` (daily volume aggregation)
- `frequencyData` (contribution heatmap data)

**Needs Implementation**:
- Muscle volume trends over time (not just current distribution)
- Exercise-specific progress tracking (1RM estimation, PRs)
- Week-by-week progressive overload analysis
- Duration efficiency metrics
- Exercise type breakdown (strength/cardio/flexibility)
- Recovery patterns

### 1.3 Analytics Page Tabs (from screenshot)

1. **Muscles** - Deep dive into muscle group analytics
2. **Duration** - Workout efficiency and time analysis
3. **Volume** - Advanced volume metrics beyond Dashboard chart
4. **Exercises** - Individual exercise progress tracking

---

## 2. User Personas & Jobs-to-be-Done

### Persona 1: The Progressive Lifter
- **Name**: Богдан (our actual user!)
- **Goals**: Track strength gains, ensure progressive overload, avoid plateaus
- **Pain Points**: Can't easily see if exercises are progressing week-to-week
- **Jobs-to-be-Done**:
  - "When I'm planning next week's workout, I want to know which exercises are stalling so I can adjust my training."
  - "When I look at my analytics, I want to see if I'm actually getting stronger, not just doing more workouts."

### Persona 2: The Efficiency Optimizer
- **Goals**: Maximize results in minimum time, avoid wasted sets
- **Pain Points**: Doesn't know if workouts are getting more efficient
- **Jobs-to-be-Done**:
  - "When I review my training, I want to know which exercises give me the most bang for my buck."
  - "When I'm short on time, I want to see which muscle groups need priority."

## 3. Feature Specifications by Tab

## Tab 1: MUSCLES

### Feature 1.1: Muscle Volume Over Time (Line Chart)
**Priority**: HIGH | **Effort**: MEDIUM | **Version**: MVP

**User Story**:
> As a user, I want to see how my training volume for each muscle group has changed over time, so I can identify trends and ensure balanced development.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Multi-line chart showing volume (kg) per muscle group over selected period
- [ ] Each muscle group has a distinct color (matches Dashboard donut colors)
- [ ] X-axis: Date (weekly aggregation)
- [ ] Y-axis: Volume (kg) with locale-aware formatting
- [ ] Legend shows muscle groups with toggle visibility
- [ ] Hovering on any point shows tooltip: Date, Muscle Group, Volume, % of total
- [ ] Responsive: Full chart on desktop, scrollable on mobile
- [ ] Empty state: "No workout data for selected period"
- [ ] Period selector: Last 7/30/90 days, All time

**Data Requirements**:
```javascript
// New computed property needed in analyticsStore
muscleVolumeOverTime = computed(() => {
  // Aggregate workouts by week
  // For each week, calculate total volume per muscle group
  // Return: [{ week: 'Dec 1', back: 5000, chest: 4000, legs: 6000, ... }]
})
```

**Differentiator from Dashboard**:
- Dashboard shows current distribution (pie chart %)
- Analytics shows **trends over time** (line chart kg)

**Technical Notes**:
- Reuse muscle group logic from `getMuscleGroups` in `src/utils/muscleUtils.js`
- Use Chart.js or Recharts (already in dependencies?)
- Weekly aggregation prevents chart overload (max 52 points for 1 year)

---

### Feature 1.2: Muscle Balance Scorecard (Table)
**Priority**: MEDIUM | **Effort**: LOW | **Version**: V1.1

**User Story**:
> As a user, I want to see if my training is balanced across muscle groups compared to ideal proportions, so I can adjust my program to avoid imbalances.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Table with columns: Muscle Group | Current % | Ideal % | Status | Difference
- [ ] Status badge:
  - ✅ Balanced (within ±10% of ideal)
  - ⚠️ Under-trained (>10% below ideal)
  - ⚠️ Over-trained (>10% above ideal)
- [ ] Sortable by difference (default: most under-trained first)
- [ ] Color-coded status: Green/Yellow/Red
- [ ] Recommendation text: "Consider adding 2 more back exercises per week"
- [ ] Collapsible section: "Understanding Muscle Balance" (educational)

**Data Requirements**:
```javascript
// Add to src/constants/config.js
analytics: {
  muscleBalance: {
    EXPECTED_DISTRIBUTION: {
      legs: 25,      // Largest muscle group
      back: 20,      // Pull dominance
      chest: 18,     // Push
      shoulders: 12, // Supporting
      biceps: 8,
      triceps: 8,
      core: 6,
      calves: 3
    },
    TOLERANCE: 10 // ±10%
  }
}
```

**i18n Keys**:
```json
{
  "analytics.muscles.balanceTable.title": "Muscle Balance Scorecard",
  "analytics.muscles.balanceTable.balanced": "Balanced",
  "analytics.muscles.balanceTable.underTrained": "Under-trained",
  "analytics.muscles.balanceTable.overTrained": "Over-trained",
  "analytics.muscles.balanceTable.recommendation": "Consider adding {count} more {muscle} exercises per week"
}
```

**Why Not on Dashboard**:
- Dashboard is for quick overview (donut chart)
- This requires deeper analysis and recommendations

---

### Feature 1.3: Muscle Fatigue Indicator (Heatmap)
**Priority**: LOW | **Effort**: HIGH | **Version**: Future (V2)

**User Story**:
> As a user, I want to see which muscle groups I train on which days of the week, so I can optimize my recovery and avoid overtraining.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] 7x8 heatmap: Days of week (rows) x Muscle groups (columns)
- [ ] Color intensity: Volume trained on that day (darker = more volume)
- [ ] Clicking a cell shows list of exercises done
- [ ] Warning badge if same muscle trained <48h apart
- [ ] Recommendation: "Consider rest day or different muscle group"

**Data Requirements**:
- Workout timestamp → Day of week mapping
- Volume per muscle per day
- Last trained date per muscle group

**Why Future**:
- Complex UX (heatmap + recommendations)
- Requires understanding of recovery science
- Lower priority than progress tracking

---

## Tab 2: DURATION

### Feature 2.1: Workout Duration Trend (Scatter + Line Chart)
**Priority**: HIGH | **Effort**: MEDIUM | **Version**: MVP

**User Story**:
> As a user, I want to see how long my workouts take over time and how duration relates to volume, so I can optimize my efficiency.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Scatter plot: X = Date, Y = Duration (minutes)
- [ ] Point size = Total volume (larger = more volume)
- [ ] Color-coded by volume quartile: Low (blue), Medium (yellow), High (green)
- [ ] Trend line overlay (linear regression)
- [ ] Statistics panel:
  - Average duration: `88 min`
  - Shortest: `45 min (Dec 1)`
  - Longest: `125 min (Nov 24)`
  - Trend: `↓ 5 min/month` (getting faster)
- [ ] Clicking point navigates to workout detail
- [ ] Tooltip: Date, Duration, Volume, Exercises count

**Data Requirements**:
```javascript
// Already available in workoutStore
workouts.forEach(w => ({
  date: w.createdAt,
  duration: w.duration, // Already tracked
  volume: calculateTotalVolume(w),
  exerciseCount: w.exercises.length
}))
```

**New Utility**:
```javascript
// src/utils/statsUtils.js
export function calculateLinearRegression(points) {
  // Returns { slope, intercept, r2 }
  // Used for trend line
}
```

**Technical Notes**:
- Duration already tracked in workouts (timestamp difference)
- Use d3-regression or implement simple linear regression
- Mobile: Show trend line only, hide individual points (too cluttered)

---

### Feature 2.2: Duration Breakdown (Stacked Bar Chart)
**Priority**: MEDIUM | **Effort**: MEDIUM | **Version**: V1.1

**User Story**:
> As a user, I want to see which exercises take the most time in my workouts, so I can identify time sinks and optimize my routine.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Stacked bar chart: Top 10 exercises by time spent
- [ ] Bar segments: Rest time (gray), Working time (blue)
- [ ] X-axis: Exercise name (truncated if needed)
- [ ] Y-axis: Total time (minutes)
- [ ] Sort options: Total time / Efficiency (volume per minute)
- [ ] Efficiency metric shown: `12.5 kg/min` (volume / time)
- [ ] Clicking bar shows detailed breakdown:
  - Sets completed: 5
  - Avg set time: 45s
  - Avg rest time: 90s
  - Total time: 11 min
  - Volume generated: 500 kg
  - Efficiency grade: B (75-100 kg/min)

**Data Requirements**:
- Need to track set timestamps (currently missing?)
- Estimate rest time if not tracked: Use `DEFAULT_REST_TIME` from config
- Calculate efficiency: `totalVolume / totalDuration`

**Implementation Challenge**:
⚠️ **Blocker**: We don't currently track set-level timestamps. Options:
1. **Estimate**: Use `setsCount * (45s working + 90s rest)` = ~2.25 min/exercise
2. **Add tracking**: Future feature to track actual set times
3. **Hybrid**: Estimate for historical data, track going forward

**Recommendation**: Start with estimation (Option 1) for MVP, add real tracking in V1.2

---

### Feature 2.3: Efficiency Score & Recommendations
**Priority**: LOW | **Effort**: HIGH | **Version**: V1.2

**User Story**:
> As a user, I want to receive personalized recommendations on how to make my workouts more efficient, so I can achieve the same results in less time.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Efficiency score card:
  - Overall score: `82/100` (kg/min)
  - Grade: A/B/C/D/F
  - Percentile: "Better than 68% of users" (if we have community data)
- [ ] Recommendations list (prioritized):
  1. 🎯 "Reduce rest time between sets from 120s to 90s (-15 min/workout)"
  2. 🎯 "Replace Dumbbell Curls with Barbell Curls (same volume, -5 min)"
  3. 🎯 "Superset opposing muscle groups (Push + Pull)"
- [ ] Impact estimation: "Save ~45 min/week"
- [ ] One-click "Apply Recommendation" → Updates workout plan

**Data Requirements**:
```javascript
// src/constants/config.js
analytics: {
  efficiency: {
    GRADE_THRESHOLDS: {
      A: 100, // kg/min
      B: 75,
      C: 50,
      D: 25,
      F: 0
    }
  }
}
```

**Algorithm**:
```javascript
// src/utils/recommendationUtils.js
export function generateEfficiencyRecommendations(workouts) {
  const avgRestTime = calculateAvgRestTime(workouts)
  const recommendations = []

  if (avgRestTime > 90) {
    recommendations.push({
      type: 'rest_time',
      impact: (avgRestTime - 90) * sets,
      suggestion: `Reduce rest to 90s`
    })
  }

  // More rules...
  return recommendations.sort((a, b) => b.impact - a.impact)
}
```

**Why V1.2**:
- Requires sophisticated logic and user testing
- Need to validate recommendations don't harm training quality
- Lower priority than core analytics

---

## Tab 3: VOLUME

### Feature 3.1: Volume Heatmap (Calendar View)
**Priority**: HIGH | **Effort**: LOW | **Version**: MVP

**User Story**:
> As a user, I want to see my daily training volume in a visual heatmap, so I can spot patterns and ensure consistent progressive overload.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] GitHub-style contribution heatmap (reuse FrequencyChart component)
- [ ] Color intensity: Total volume (kg) per day
- [ ] Color scale: Light blue (low) → Dark blue (high)
- [ ] Tooltip: Date, Total volume, Workouts count, Top exercise
- [ ] Legend: "Less" ← → "More" with color gradient
- [ ] Clicking day navigates to workout detail
- [ ] Empty state: Gray (no workout)
- [ ] Period: Last 12 months

**Data Requirements**:
```javascript
// Similar to frequencyData, but keyed by volume
dailyVolumeMap = computed(() => {
  const map = {}
  workouts.value.forEach(w => {
    const date = formatDate(w.createdAt, 'YYYY-MM-DD')
    map[date] = (map[date] || 0) + calculateTotalVolume(w)
  })
  return map
})
```

**Differentiator from Dashboard Frequency**:
- Dashboard Frequency: Shows **workout count** (did you train?)
- Analytics Volume Heatmap: Shows **volume intensity** (how hard did you train?)

**Technical Notes**:
- **Reuse** `src/pages/dashboard/components/charts/FrequencyChart.vue`
- Modify to accept `volumeMap` prop instead of `frequencyMap`
- Color scale based on volume percentiles (not binary yes/no)

---

### Feature 3.2: Volume by Exercise Type (Donut Chart)
**Priority**: MEDIUM | **Effort**: LOW | **Version**: V1.1

**User Story**:
> As a user, I want to see what percentage of my training volume comes from different exercise types (strength/cardio/etc.), so I can ensure I'm following a balanced program.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Donut chart with segments: Strength, Cardio, Flexibility, Other
- [ ] Center shows total volume with unit
- [ ] Percentages on segments
- [ ] Legend with absolute values:
  - Strength: `68,450 kg` (92%)
  - Cardio: `4,200 kg` (6%)
  - Flexibility: `1,500 kg` (2%)
- [ ] Clicking segment filters exercise list below
- [ ] Color-coded: Strength (blue), Cardio (red), Flexibility (green)

**Data Requirements**:
```javascript
// Need to add exerciseType to exercise metadata
// Extend src/stores/exerciseStore.js
exerciseLibrary: [
  {
    id: 'bench-press',
    name: 'Bench Press',
    muscleGroups: ['chest', 'triceps'],
    type: 'strength', // NEW field
    equipment: 'barbell'
  },
  // ...
]
```

**Migration Note**:
- Existing exercises default to `type: 'strength'`
- Add type selector when creating new exercises

**Differentiator from Dashboard Muscle Distribution**:
- Dashboard: Muscle groups (where)
- Analytics: Exercise types (what)

---

### Feature 3.3: Progressive Overload Tracker (Bar Chart)
**Priority**: HIGH | **Effort**: MEDIUM | **Version**: MVP

**User Story**:
> As a user, I want to see if I'm increasing my training volume week over week, so I know if I'm actually progressing or just maintaining.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Bar chart: X = Week number, Y = Total volume (kg)
- [ ] Each bar color-coded:
  - 🟢 Green: Volume increased ≥2.5% from previous week (progressing)
  - 🟡 Yellow: Volume within ±2.5% (maintaining)
  - 🔴 Red: Volume decreased >2.5% (regressing)
- [ ] Percentage change label on each bar: `+5.2%`
- [ ] Target line overlay: Expected progression (2.5%/week)
- [ ] Statistics panel:
  - Weeks progressing: `8/12` (67%)
  - Average weekly increase: `+3.1%`
  - Status: 🟢 "On track for progressive overload"
  - Next week target: `7,890 kg`
- [ ] Clicking bar expands to show exercise breakdown
- [ ] Period selector: Last 8/12/26 weeks

**Data Requirements**:
```javascript
// New computed in analyticsStore
weeklyVolumeProgression = computed(() => {
  const weeks = groupWorkoutsByWeek(workouts.value)
  return weeks.map((week, i) => {
    const prevWeek = weeks[i - 1]
    const change = prevWeek ? (week.volume - prevWeek.volume) / prevWeek.volume * 100 : 0
    return {
      weekNumber: week.weekNumber,
      weekStart: week.startDate,
      volume: week.volume,
      change,
      status: change >= 2.5 ? 'progressing' : change <= -2.5 ? 'regressing' : 'maintaining'
    }
  })
})
```

**New Utility**:
```javascript
// src/utils/dateUtils.js
export function getWeekNumber(date) {
  // ISO week number (1-52)
}

export function groupWorkoutsByWeek(workouts) {
  // Group workouts by week, sum volume
}
```

**Constants**:
```javascript
// src/constants/config.js
analytics: {
  progressiveOverload: {
    TARGET_WEEKLY_INCREASE: 2.5, // %
    STALL_THRESHOLD: 2.5, // %
    MIN_WEEKS_FOR_TREND: 4
  }
}
```

**Why Critical for Analytics**:
- Progressive overload is THE #1 principle of strength training
- Dashboard Period Comparison only shows current vs previous (too coarse)
- This shows week-by-week trends

---

## Tab 4: EXERCISES

### Feature 4.1: Exercise Progress Table
**Priority**: HIGH | **Effort**: HIGH | **Version**: MVP

**User Story**:
> As a user, I want to see all my exercises with their estimated 1RM, PRs, and progress trends, so I can identify which exercises are progressing and which are stalling.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Table with columns:
  - Exercise name (sortable alphabetically)
  - Estimated 1RM (sortable, calculated via Epley formula)
  - Best PR (weight × reps)
  - Last performed (date)
  - Trend (↑ Progressing / → Stalled / ↓ Regressing)
  - Status badge (color-coded)
- [ ] Default sort: Trend descending (stalling exercises first)
- [ ] Filtering:
  - By muscle group
  - By status (Progressing/Stalled/Regressing)
  - Search by exercise name
- [ ] Expandable rows: Clicking row shows mini progress chart (last 10 workouts)
- [ ] Empty state: "No exercises tracked yet"
- [ ] Pagination: 20 exercises per page (if >20)
- [ ] Export to CSV button (top right)

**Data Requirements**:
```javascript
// New computed in analyticsStore
exerciseProgressTable = computed(() => {
  const exerciseMap = new Map()

  workouts.value.forEach(workout => {
    workout.exercises.forEach(exercise => {
      const history = exerciseMap.get(exercise.name) || []
      history.push({
        date: workout.createdAt,
        sets: exercise.sets,
        bestSet: findBestSet(exercise.sets) // Highest weight × reps
      })
      exerciseMap.set(exercise.name, history)
    })
  })

  return Array.from(exerciseMap.entries()).map(([name, history]) => {
    const sorted = history.sort((a, b) => b.date - a.date)
    const lastPerformed = sorted[0]
    const estimated1RM = calculate1RM(lastPerformed.bestSet)
    const trend = calculateTrend(history) // Uses linear regression

    return {
      name,
      estimated1RM,
      bestPR: findBestPR(history),
      lastPerformed: lastPerformed.date,
      trend: trend.direction, // 'up', 'flat', 'down'
      trendPercentage: trend.percentage,
      status: getProgressStatus(trend),
      history: sorted.slice(0, 10) // Last 10 for chart
    }
  })
})
```

**1RM Calculation (Epley Formula)**:
```javascript
// src/utils/strengthUtils.js
export function calculate1RM(weight, reps) {
  if (reps === 1) return weight
  if (reps > 15) return null // Formula unreliable >15 reps
  return weight * (1 + reps / 30)
}

// Example:
calculate1RM(100, 5) // 116.67 kg (estimated 1RM)
calculate1RM(100, 1) // 100 kg (actual 1RM)
```

**Trend Calculation**:
```javascript
export function calculateTrend(history) {
  if (history.length < 4) return { direction: 'insufficient_data', percentage: 0 }

  const points = history.map((h, i) => ({
    x: i,
    y: calculate1RM(h.bestSet.weight, h.bestSet.reps)
  }))

  const regression = calculateLinearRegression(points)
  const percentageChange = (regression.slope / points[0].y) * 100

  return {
    direction: percentageChange > 2.5 ? 'up' : percentageChange < -2.5 ? 'down' : 'flat',
    percentage: percentageChange,
    r2: regression.r2 // Confidence indicator
  }
}
```

**Status Badge Logic**:
```javascript
function getProgressStatus(trend) {
  if (trend.direction === 'up') return { label: 'Progressing', color: 'green' }
  if (trend.direction === 'down') return { label: 'Regressing', color: 'red' }
  if (trend.direction === 'flat') return { label: 'Stalled', color: 'yellow' }
  return { label: 'New', color: 'gray' }
}
```

**i18n Keys**:
```json
{
  "analytics.exercises.table.columns.exercise": "Exercise",
  "analytics.exercises.table.columns.estimated1rm": "Est. 1RM",
  "analytics.exercises.table.columns.bestPR": "Best PR",
  "analytics.exercises.table.columns.lastPerformed": "Last Done",
  "analytics.exercises.table.columns.trend": "Trend",
  "analytics.exercises.table.status.progressing": "Progressing",
  "analytics.exercises.table.status.stalled": "Stalled",
  "analytics.exercises.table.status.regressing": "Regressing",
  "analytics.exercises.table.status.new": "New Exercise"
}
```

**Technical Notes**:
- Reuse Table components from shadcn-vue (Table, TableBody, TableCell, etc.)
- Mini chart: Use Sparkline component (lightweight)
- Export CSV: Use `downloadCSV` utility function
- Mobile: Hide "Last Performed" column, show only Exercise + 1RM + Status

---

### Feature 4.2: Exercise PR Timeline
**Priority**: MEDIUM | **Effort**: MEDIUM | **Version**: V1.1

**User Story**:
> As a user, I want to see a timeline of all my personal records, so I can celebrate my achievements and stay motivated.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Vertical timeline showing all PRs in chronological order (newest first)
- [ ] Each PR entry shows:
  - Date
  - Exercise name
  - PR type: 💪 Weight PR / 🔢 Rep PR / 🏆 Volume PR
  - Previous best → New best (with +% increase)
  - Celebration emoji or badge
- [ ] Filtering:
  - By PR type
  - By exercise
  - By date range
- [ ] Empty state: "No PRs yet. Keep training! 💪"
- [ ] Sharing: "Share your PR" button (generates image for social media)

**Data Requirements**:
```javascript
// Extend exerciseProgressTable logic
function findAllPRs(exerciseHistory) {
  const prs = []
  let maxWeight = 0
  let maxReps = 0
  let maxVolume = 0

  exerciseHistory.forEach(workout => {
    workout.exercises.forEach(exercise => {
      const { weight, reps } = findBestSet(exercise.sets)
      const volume = calculateExerciseVolume(exercise)

      // Weight PR
      if (weight > maxWeight) {
        prs.push({
          date: workout.createdAt,
          exercise: exercise.name,
          type: 'weight',
          previous: maxWeight,
          new: weight,
          increase: ((weight - maxWeight) / maxWeight * 100) || 0
        })
        maxWeight = weight
      }

      // Rep PR (at same weight)
      if (weight === maxWeight && reps > maxReps) {
        prs.push({ type: 'rep', ... })
        maxReps = reps
      }

      // Volume PR
      if (volume > maxVolume) {
        prs.push({ type: 'volume', ... })
        maxVolume = volume
      }
    })
  })

  return prs.sort((a, b) => b.date - a.date)
}
```

**UI Component**:
```vue
<!-- PRTimeline.vue -->

**Celebration Features** (V1.2):
- Confetti animation on new PR (using canvas-confetti library)
- Push notification: "🎉 New PR! Bench Press: 120 kg"
- PR streak tracking: "5 PRs this month!"

---

### Feature 4.3: Exercise Strength Standards
**Priority**: LOW | **Effort**: HIGH | **Version**: Future (V2)

**User Story**:
> As a user, I want to see how my lifts compare to strength standards (beginner/intermediate/advanced), so I can gauge my progress objectively.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] For each exercise, show strength standard classification:
  - Beginner
  - Novice
  - Intermediate
  - Advanced
  - Elite
- [ ] Based on bodyweight ratio (e.g., Bench Press 1.5x bodyweight = Intermediate)
- [ ] Progress bar showing current level and distance to next level
- [ ] Separate standards for male/female (if user provides gender)
- [ ] Standards for main compound lifts: Squat, Bench, Deadlift, OHP
- [ ] Disclaimer: "Standards are approximate. Focus on your own progress."

**Data Requirements**:
```javascript
// src/constants/strengthStandards.js
export const STRENGTH_STANDARDS = {
  'bench-press': {
    male: {
      beginner: 0.5,    // x bodyweight
      novice: 0.75,
      intermediate: 1.25,
      advanced: 1.75,
      elite: 2.0
    },
    female: {
      beginner: 0.3,
      novice: 0.5,
      intermediate: 0.75,
      advanced: 1.0,
      elite: 1.25
    }
  },
  // ... other exercises
}
```

**Why Future**:
- Requires user bodyweight tracking (not currently implemented)
- Requires gender field (optional, sensitive)
- Lower priority than core progress tracking
- Risk of demotivation if user sees "beginner" label

## 4. Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: MVP (Sprint 1-2) - 3 weeks
**Goal**: Ship 5 core analytics features (1-2 per tab) to validate user engagement

**Features**:
1. ✅ Muscle Volume Over Time (Tab 1)
2. ✅ Workout Duration Trend (Tab 2)
3. ✅ Volume Heatmap (Tab 3)
4. ✅ Progressive Overload Tracker (Tab 3)
5. ✅ Exercise Progress Table (Tab 4)

**Success Metrics**:
- 40% of users visit Analytics page within 7 days
- Avg time on page >90 seconds
- Exercise Progress Table most interacted feature

**Technical Debt Accepted**:
- Duration breakdown uses estimated times (not real tracking)
- No export functionality yet
- No PR timeline yet

---

### Phase 2: V1.1 (Sprint 3-4) - 2 weeks
**Goal**: Add depth to each tab, improve UX based on MVP feedback

**Features**:
1. ✅ Muscle Balance Scorecard (Tab 1)
2. ✅ Duration Breakdown (Tab 2)
3. ✅ Volume by Exercise Type (Tab 3)
4. ✅ Exercise PR Timeline (Tab 4)

**Improvements**:
- Add export to CSV for all tables
- Add period selector to all charts
- Mobile UX polish (responsive charts)
- Loading states and error handling
- Empty state illustrations

**Success Metrics**:
- Retention: 60% of MVP users return to Analytics
- Feature adoption: 30% use Muscle Balance, 50% use PR Timeline

---

### Phase 3: V1.2 (Sprint 5) - 1 week
**Goal**: Add smart recommendations and efficiency features

**Features**:
1. ✅ Efficiency Score & Recommendations (Tab 2)
2. ✅ PR Celebration Animations (Tab 4)
3. ✅ Real-time set duration tracking (foundation for better Duration analytics)

**Technical Improvements**:
- Add set-level timestamps to workout data model
- Implement recommendation engine
- Add unit tests for 1RM calculations and trend algorithms

---

### Phase 4: V2 (Future) - 3+ months
**Goal**: Advanced features based on user requests and analytics trends

**Potential Features**:
1. 🔮 Muscle Fatigue Indicator
2. 🔮 Exercise Strength Standards
3. 🔮 Social sharing of analytics
4. 🔮 Custom analytics (user-defined metrics)
5. 🔮 AI workout recommendations based on analytics
6. 🔮 Community benchmarking (compare to similar users)

**Prerequisites**:
- Large user base for benchmarking
- User bodyweight tracking
- Enhanced data collection (sleep, nutrition if integrated)

## 7. Performance Considerations

### 7.1 Data Aggregation

**Challenge**: Large datasets (100+ workouts with 500+ exercises) can slow down computed properties.

**Solutions**:
1. **Weekly aggregation** for time-series data (max 52 points for 1 year)
2. **Memoization** of expensive calculations (1RM, linear regression)
3. **Lazy loading** of chart components (Vue's `defineAsyncComponent`)
4. **Virtualization** for long tables (>50 exercises)

```javascript
// Example: Memoized 1RM calculation
const e1rmCache = new Map()

function calculate1RMMemoized(weight, reps) {
  const key = `${weight}-${reps}`
  if (e1rmCache.has(key)) return e1rmCache.get(key)

  const result = calculate1RM(weight, reps)
  e1rmCache.set(key, result)
  return result
}
```

### 7.2 Chart Rendering

**Recommendations**:
- Use **Recharts** (already familiar from Dashboard) for consistency
- Implement **responsive** prop to hide less critical data on mobile
- Add **loading skeletons** during data computation
- Debounce period selector changes (500ms)

### 7.3 Mobile Optimization

- Hide less critical columns on mobile (e.g., "Last Performed")
- Use horizontal scroll for wide tables
- Simplify charts (e.g., show trend line only, hide individual points)
- Implement "Show More" pagination (20 items per page)

## 8. Success Metrics & KPIs

### 8.1 Adoption Metrics

**Primary**:
- **Analytics page visits**: Target 60% of active users within 30 days of launch
- **Return visits**: Target 40% of visitors return within 7 days
- **Time on page**: Target >2 minutes average (indicates engagement)

**Secondary**:
- **Tab popularity**: Which tab gets most clicks?
- **Period selector usage**: Do users explore different time ranges?
- **Export usage**: Do users export data?

### 8.2 Feature-Specific Metrics

**Exercise Progress Table**:
- % of users who expand rows (indicates detail interest)
- % of users who sort/filter (indicates active analysis)

**Progressive Overload Chart**:
- % of users in "progressing" vs "stalled" status
- Avg weeks progressing per user (health indicator)

**PR Timeline**:
- Avg PRs per user per month (gamification metric)
- Share button clicks (social validation)

### 8.3 Behavior Change Metrics

**Ultimate Goal**: Does Analytics lead to better training outcomes?

- **Training consistency**: Do Analytics users have higher workout frequency?
- **Progressive overload adherence**: Do users increase volume after seeing "stalled" status?
- **Muscle balance**: Do users add under-trained muscle groups after seeing scorecard?

**Instrumentation**:
```javascript
// Example analytics event
trackEvent('analytics_feature_viewed', {
  feature: 'exercise_progress_table',
  tab: 'exercises',
  period: 'last_30_days'
})

trackEvent('analytics_action_taken', {
  action: 'sorted_by_stalled',
  result: 'user_started_workout_with_stalled_exercise'
})
```

## 9. Risk Mitigation

### 9.1 Technical Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| **Chart performance** with >365 data points | Medium | High | Weekly aggregation, max 52 points per year |
| **Inaccurate 1RM** calculations | High | Medium | Show disclaimer, cap at 15 reps, allow manual override |
| **Missing duration data** for old workouts | High | Low | Estimate using avg duration, show "estimated" badge |
| **Browser compatibility** (Safari date issues) | Low | Medium | Use date-fns for all date operations |

### 9.2 Product Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| **Users overwhelmed** by too many charts | Medium | High | Progressive disclosure: MVP → V1.1 → V1.2 |
| **Analytics don't drive behavior change** | Medium | High | Add actionable recommendations, not just data |
| **Users prefer simpler Dashboard** | Low | Medium | Keep Dashboard as default, Analytics as power feature |
| **1RM/strength standards demotivate beginners** | Medium | Medium | Emphasize personal progress over standards, hide standards by default |

### 9.3 Data Privacy Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| **Sensitive PR data** (might reveal physical capabilities) | All data stored in user's Firestore, never shared publicly |
| **Bodyweight data** (if added for strength standards) | Optional field, clearly marked as private |
| **Community benchmarking** (if added) | Opt-in only, anonymized aggregates |

## 10. Future Enhancements (V3+)

### 10.1 AI-Powered Insights

**Concept**: Use simple ML models to provide predictive analytics

Examples:
- "Based on your trend, you'll hit 100kg bench press by March 15"
- "Your squat is progressing faster than your deadlift. Consider balancing."
- "You train chest 2x/week but back 1x/week. Risk of imbalance."

**Tech**: Client-side TensorFlow.js for simple linear predictions

### 10.2 Social Features

**Leaderboards**:
- Top PRs in your gym (if group feature added)
- Community strength standards (opt-in)

**Challenges**:
- "Complete 50 PRs this quarter"
- "Achieve 90% balanced training"

### 10.3 Integration with Wearables

**Concept**: Import data from Apple Health / Google Fit

Benefits:
- Accurate workout duration (auto-tracked)
- Heart rate data for volume load calculations
- Sleep/recovery data for fatigue analysis

**Priority**: Low (requires significant integration work)

### 10.4 Export & Reporting

**PDF Reports**:
- Monthly analytics summary with charts
- Progress report to share with coach

**API Access**:
- Allow users to export raw data via JSON API
- Enable third-party integrations (Excel, Google Sheets)

## 12. Open Questions

1. **Bodyweight tracking**: Do we add this feature now or later? (Needed for strength standards)
   - **Recommendation**: Later (V2). Focus on relative progress first.

2. **Set duration tracking**: Should we start tracking timestamps for each set?
   - **Recommendation**: Add in V1.2. Estimate for MVP, track going forward.

3. **Exercise type taxonomy**: How do we classify exercises (strength/cardio/flexibility)?
   - **Recommendation**: Add `type` field to exercise library, default to 'strength' for existing.

4. **Community features**: Do we want public leaderboards or keep everything private?
   - **Recommendation**: Private for MVP/V1, opt-in community features in V2.

5. **Chart library**: Recharts vs Chart.js vs D3?
   - **Recommendation**: Recharts (already used in Dashboard, React-based but works in Vue).

6. **Mobile-first vs Desktop-first**: Which experience to prioritize?
   - **Recommendation**: Mobile-first for quick stats, Desktop for detailed analysis.

## 13. Appendix

### A. Formula Reference

**Epley 1RM Formula**:
```
1RM = weight × (1 + reps / 30)
```

**Linear Regression**:
```
slope = (n·Σxy - Σx·Σy) / (n·Σx² - (Σx)²)
intercept = (Σy - slope·Σx) / n
```

**R-squared (Coefficient of Determination)**:
```
R² = 1 - (SS_res / SS_tot)
where:
  SS_res = Σ(y - ŷ)²  (residual sum of squares)
  SS_tot = Σ(y - ȳ)²  (total sum of squares)
```

**Progressive Overload Status**:
```
if change ≥ 2.5%: status = 'progressing'
else if change ≤ -2.5%: status = 'regressing'
else: status = 'maintaining'
```

### B. Date Utilities

**ISO Week Number** (ISO 8601):
```javascript
function getWeekNumber(date) {
  const d = new Date(Date.UTC(date.getFullYear(), date.getMonth(), date.getDate()))
  const dayNum = d.getUTCDay() || 7
  d.setUTCDate(d.getUTCDate() + 4 - dayNum)
  const yearStart = new Date(Date.UTC(d.getUTCFullYear(), 0, 1))
  return Math.ceil((((d - yearStart) / 86400000) + 1) / 7)
}
```

**Start of Week** (Monday-based):
```javascript
function startOfWeek(date) {
  const d = new Date(date)
  const day = d.getDay()
  const diff = d.getDate() - day + (day === 0 ? -6 : 1) // Adjust when Sunday
  return new Date(d.setDate(diff))
}
```

### C. Color Palette

**Muscle Group Colors** (match Dashboard donut):
```javascript
const MUSCLE_COLORS = {
  back: '#3b82f6',      // blue-500
  chest: '#f97316',     // orange-500
  legs: '#10b981',      // green-500
  biceps: '#a855f7',    // purple-500
  shoulders: '#ec4899', // pink-500
  triceps: '#14b8a6',   // teal-500
  calves: '#8b5cf6',    // violet-500
  core: '#06b6d4'       // cyan-500
}
```

**Status Colors**:
```javascript
const STATUS_COLORS = {
  progressing: '#10b981', // green-500
  maintaining: '#f59e0b', // amber-500
  regressing: '#ef4444',  // red-500
  balanced: '#10b981',
  underTrained: '#f59e0b',
  overTrained: '#ef4444'
}
```

### D. Dependencies Review

**No new dependencies needed** (all available in current stack):
- Charts: Recharts (already used)
- Date utilities: date-fns (already used)
- Tables: shadcn-vue Table components (already installed)
- Icons: lucide-vue-next (already used)
- Animations: tw-animate-css (already installed)

**Optional future dependencies**:
- `canvas-confetti` for PR celebrations (V1.2)
- `jspdf` for PDF export (V2)
- `papaparse` for CSV export enhancement (V1.1)

### E. File Size Estimation

**Code additions** (estimated):
- New computed properties: ~500 lines
- New utility files: ~400 lines
- New components: ~1200 lines
- i18n keys: ~300 lines
- Tests: ~800 lines

**Total**: ~3200 lines of new code for MVP

## 14. Conclusion

This PRD defines a comprehensive, phased approach to building the Analytics section for Obsessed. By focusing on **actionable insights** rather than vanity metrics, we ensure users get real value that improves their training.

**Key Takeaways**:
1. **Avoid Dashboard duplication** - Analytics provides depth, Dashboard provides overview
2. **Progressive disclosure** - MVP → V1.1 → V1.2 → V2 prevents overwhelming users
3. **Mobile-first execution** - Optimize for gym use case (quick insights on phone)
4. **Behavior-driven features** - Every chart should help users make a training decision
5. **Data-driven iteration** - Track adoption metrics to guide V1.1+ priorities

**Next Steps**:
1. Review this PRD with stakeholders
2. Break down MVP into Jira/Linear tasks
3. Assign Sprint 1 tasks to development team
4. Begin implementation with Tab 3 (Volume) as it has highest priority features
